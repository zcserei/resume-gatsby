# gatsby-emotional-starter

A simple [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) starter using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh) for styling and a few other packages - like Typography - that often come in handy.

You can get started by running `gatsby new my-emotional-project https://github.com/Holistio/gatsby-emotional-starter`.

All this is not quite that emotional, but if you can't see through the tears you should consult the [Gatsby Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

Please note that as of now, this project is a huge pile of mess and everything about it is just fucking cringeworthy. But also, it's not too complicated, so it might just happen to work. Contributions are welcome.
